## Notes

This is a linear Parallel Coordinates report graph. He can freely adjust the location of different data, and can also select the data you like. Check the four boxes to find the data you want. The framed data will become opaque.

## Included files

* a08.js -run file
* d3.js - core file
* index.html - show file
* iris.js - data file
* README.md this file

## References
I added Inverting axes (e.g. switching their minimum and maximum). You can adjust it freely, and there will be no problem of brush not refreshing. There will be no bugs when exchanging data names.
